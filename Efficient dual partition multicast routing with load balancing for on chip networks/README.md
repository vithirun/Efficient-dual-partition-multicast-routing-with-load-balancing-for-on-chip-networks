# Undergraduate-Final-Year-Project

ABSTRACT

Without efficient multicasting support, traditional unicasting on-chip networks will be low efficiency in tackling such multicast communication. In this project, we propose Dual Partition Multicast (DPM) Routing with load balancing to increase
the throughput, minimize power consumption and balance network resource utilization.

Specifically, DPM scheme adaptively makes routing decisions based on the network load-balance level characterized by the distribution of the multicasting destinations. The algorithm implemented in this project is also extended to stand against faulty links and aid uniform traffic distribution.
